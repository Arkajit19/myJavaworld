1) Create a class which will have a data member “x” (integer). Define two methods to accept 
the value and show the value of x. In main class these two methods after creating an object 
of the previous class.
2) Find factorial of user input number with recursion

3) Write a program to check whether a user input which is string type is palindrom or not.

4) Write a program to count occurence of number of vowels in an user input string.
5) Java program to reverse a String(using loop)
6) Java program to reverse a String(using recursion)
7) Java program to reverse a String(using StringBuffer)
8) Write a java program to check if two Strings are anagram in java(Using String methods)
9) Write a java program to check if two Strings are anagram in java(Using Array sort)
10) Write a Java program to print the result of the following operations.<br>
	Test Data:<br>
	a. -5 + 8 * 6 <br>
	b. (55+9) % 9 <br>
	c. 20 + -3*5 / 8<br>
	d. 5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3<br>

11)Write a Java program that takes two numbers as input and display the product of two numbers.<br>
12)Write a Java program to get a number from the user and print whether it is positive or negative.<br>
13)Write a Java program to solve quadratic equations (use if, else if and else).<br>
14)Write a Java program to create a new array list, add some colors (string) and print out the collection.<br>
15)Create a java program to check whether a number is Armstrong number or not!<br>
16)Create a student class having data members- “roll”, “name”; Have the constructors which 
will be parameterizable, object passable and including the default constructor in it. In main 
class test each constructor.<br>
17)Create program which will print the area of rectangle or circle as per provided inputs, using 
polymorphism.<br>
18)Create a class “Event” having data members- “name”, “time”; there will be “acceptName”, 
“acceptTime” and “show” methods defined. Now two classes "footballMatch" and 
"musicConcert" will be inherited from “Event” class. Use “super” and “this” keyword where 
required and make some suitable changes in inherited classes and finally print all the details 
of those two classes’ data members.<br>
19)Write a Java program to insert an element into the array list at the first position.<br>
20)Write a Java program to retrieve an element (at a specified index) from a given array list.<br>
